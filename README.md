# Immersious
Finally, a (slightly scuffed) solution for language learning through immersion on ios!  
Immersious is a website video player that supports highlightable subtitle along with resyncing of subtitles within the application.
This means that it can be used in conjunction with 10ten reader to quickly scan and look up words as you watch (assuming you are learning Japanese).  

# Usage Instructions
Immersing with immersious couldn't be easier (actually no, it probably could, just use android), here are some simple steps you can follow:
- First, go to [notasmartsnake.github.io/immersious](notasmartsnake.github.io/immersious),
- Upload a video file, pretty sure ios doesn't support mkv though because it SUCKS!!
- An interface will show up when the video is paused, in the top left of this interface, there is a button you can use to import a subtitle file, both srt and ass are supported.
- Watch anime! Have a good day.

After importing a subtitle file, buttons for adjusting subtitle offset will show up in the top right corner of the pause menu, use these buttons if your video is offsync.  
Also, if you are learning Japanese specifically, and want an even better experience, download 10ten reader on the app store, and activate the extension while on the immersious website, then you can use the 'puck' to scan the subtitles

# Important Note
some encodings of mp4 are not compatible with modern browsers, I don't know if that is a practical issue, but you might encounter it at some point
